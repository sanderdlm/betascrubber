        <h1>About</h1>
        <p><strong>BetaScrubber</strong> helps climbers save and study beta videos, one move at a time.</p>
        <p>Drop in a YouTube link, pick the key frames, and scrub through them to break down the sequence in detail.</p>
        <p>The tool was built for real-world use. When you're at the crag with bad reception and just need to see the beta. I first made it after struggling to load videos while climbing in Fontainebleau.</p>
        <p>A typical one-minute YouTube Short can use around 20 MB of data. The same clip on BetaScrubber loads in about 50 KB, or 500 KB for all frames combined.</p>
        <p>Free accounts keep frames for one hour. Subscribing for $6/month gives you unlimited storage time.</p>
        <p>All frames are cached for long-term access, so once you've loaded a boulder, you can still review it later even when you're offline.</p>
